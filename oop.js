Notes on objects and OOP programing:
-----------
//oop was newish with ES6
//it isn't always used, but it is important to know
//most commonly used methodology of how to write code
//oop is similar to objects in the real world

//objects have
//  attributes
//  funtionality
//  the ability to interact with other objects

//think of things that we are programming is invidivual objects that interact with other objects
//thinking about our code as objects helps us build things that are sustainable

//aspects of OOP
// abstaction
//      Allows us to hide complexity
// encapsolation
//      hiding the details of how the method works
// inheratance
//      allows objects to inherent things from parent classes 
// polymorphism
//      allows an object to be responsive to what it is serving

//classes are logical ways to group coding to make them into objects

//classes are the big "blueprints"
//  objects and instances are the things constructed from the blueprints
